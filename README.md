# Socket Programming Chat Server 
Simple Python Chat Application This is a basic, command-line chat application built with Python's socket and threading modules. The project demonstrates a fundamental client-server architecture for real-time, multi-user communication over a network.  Features Client-Server Model: The application is split into a central server that manages connections and multiple clients that can join the chat.  Multi-Client Support: The server uses multithreading to handle simultaneous connections from multiple clients, allowing everyone to chat in the same room.  Real-Time Messaging: Messages typed by any client are instantly broadcast to all other connected clients.  Concurrent Operation: The client program uses threading to allow the user to type messages while simultaneously receiving messages from the server.  How to Use To run this chat application, you will need to have Python installed on your system.  1. The Server The server must be started first. It will listen for incoming connections from clients.  Save the server code into a file named chat_server.py.  Open a terminal or command prompt.  Run the server using the following command:  python chat_server.py  You will see a message confirming that the server has started and is listening for connections.  2. The Client Once the server is running, you can connect clients to it. You can open multiple client instances to simulate a chat room with multiple users.  Save the client code into a file named chat_client.py.  Open a new terminal or command prompt.  Run the client using the following command:  python chat_client.py  You will see a message confirming that you have connected to the chat server.  You can now type messages and press Enter to send them to the chat room. All messages from other clients will also appear in your terminal.  Technical Details socket Module: Provides the low-level networking primitives for creating and managing TCP connections between the server and clients.  threading Module: This is a crucial component for the server to handle multiple clients concurrently without blocking. Each client gets its own thread, ensuring smooth operation. On the client side, it separates the "send" and "receive" loops so the user can type while new messages are coming in.  Future Enhancements Usernames: Implement a system for clients to enter and use a unique username.  Private Messaging: Add a feature that allows users to send messages to a specific recipient instead of broadcasting to all.  GUI: Develop a graphical user interface using libraries like Tkinter, PyQt, or PyGame for a more user-friendly experience.
